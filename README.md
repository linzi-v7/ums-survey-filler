# UMS Survey Auto-Filler Chrome Extension

**UMS** stands for **Ain Shams University Management System**, the official platform for Ain Shams University. You can access it at [ums.asu.edu.eg](https://ums.asu.edu.eg/). This extension simplifies the process of filling out course questionnaires, which are required to be completed before you can view your yearwork grades. It was developed to save time and eliminate the frustration of repeatedly filling out these surveys while reducing manual effort.

## Features

- **Auto-Fills UMS Surveys:** Automatically fills out surveys with the desired ratings.
- **Effortless Submission**: Automatically scrolls to the submit button once the form is filled.
- **Time-Saving**: Reduces manual input, saving you time and effort.

## Future Improvements

- **Dropdown Handling:** Improve support for dropdown menus in surveys.
- **UI Enhancements:** Create a more user-friendly interface for configuration and feedback.
- **Randomized Ratings:** Add the ability to randomize ratings for a more diverse survey completion (instead of filling the same rating every time).

## Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to install and use the extension:

1. **Download the Extension:**
   - Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. **Enable Developer Mode in Chrome:**
   - Open [Chrome Extensions](chrome://extensions/) in your browser.
   - Toggle the **Developer mode** switch in the top right corner to **ON**.

3. **Unpack the Extension:**
   - Click the **Load unpacked** button.
   - Select the folder where you downloaded the extension folder.

4. **Activate the Extension:**
   - The extension icon should now appear in the Chrome toolbar.
   - Click on the icon to activate it when you're on a UMS survey page.
   - The extension will automatically fill out the survey fields based on your desired rating.

### Important Note

For surveys with a **TA Dropbox** section, no option needs to be selected in order to successfully submit the survey. The extension will handle submission even without selecting an option in that section.
